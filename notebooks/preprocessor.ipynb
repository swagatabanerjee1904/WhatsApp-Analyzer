      "29/01/2020, 10:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24.\n",
      "To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.\n",

Many people will tell u that u don't need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it's better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews.\n",
      "What u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don't expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem.\n",

      "The function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class.

      "11/04/2020, 9:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread.\n",
      "Interfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.\n",

      "I would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy.\n",
      "After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus\n",
      "Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.\n",

      "28/05/2020, 2:36 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap.\n",
      "28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but it only imports the code that is called...\n",

      "28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called?\n",
      "28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line.\n",
      "28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library.\n",

      "28/05/2020, 2:41 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): However, there is something called \"Tree Shaking\" where unused portions of the library are removed.\n",
      "28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library.\n",
      "28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh\n",
      "28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you lose the benefit of a CDN.\n",

      "28/05/2020, 2:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website.\n",

That's why for cp, you have to think for an hour at least on every problem that's hard for you. People spend days solving a single question in CodeChef Long Challenge(8 questions 10 days to solve).

And in interviews, they won't ask you questions which are already there on gfg(for FAANG companies). They'll always slightly change the question. To solve the question during interview you should have excellent problem solving skills.\n",

      "10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): apt uses dpkg internally.\n",

      "10/07/2020, 7:42 pm - +91 97681 67131: But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right??\n",
      "10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies.\n",
      "But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order.\n",
      "10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager.\n",

      "03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Scanner operates on a token stream, as opposed to BufferedReader, which operates on lines.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So, imagine Scanner gets the inputs:\n",
      "```10\\nHello, World!\\n```\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Didn't see the code\n",

      "03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, it is important to understand what the ```nextInt()``` method actually does.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 97027 35002: Explain sir\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\\d+/```\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning + or -, followed by one or more digits.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okay\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So Scanner reads the token stream, finds 10 and returns it.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now the stream is: ```\\nHello, World!\\n```\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 12:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\\n```).\n",
      "03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (without the newline)\n",
      "03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\\nHello, World!\\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline.\n",
      "03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So basically \n",
      "It returned nothing in my case\n",
      "03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which means it will return an empty string.\n",

But here Integer caching changes the results.Integer class has a caching range of -128 to 127. Whenever a number is between this range and autoboxing is used, it assigns the same reference. That‚Äôs why for value 100, both num1 and num2 will have the same reference, but for the value 500 (not in the range of -128 to 127), num3 and num4 will have different reference.\n",

      "The other day I read this story of a fledgling Python coder named Seth on Reddit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Seth's been learning Python for 5 months, and things have been \"hit and miss\" for a while now.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks ago he completed a free coding course. But since then his progress came to a grinding halt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seth's doing fine at the small exercises‚Äîwrite a function here, reverse this list there‚Äîbut when it comes to writing more substantial programs on his own, he just can't get them to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Seth embarked on his \"coding journey\" a fire burned in his belly, but now he doesn't really feel enthusiastic about anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not like his motivation is dead and gone‚Äî\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time he looks at the neat stuff he could use his programming skills for, he knows deep down that he WANTS to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the fire he once felt for Python and coding in general has faded into a dim glow at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seth started out learning Python with a friend, but his friend surpassed him within three weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seth still feels like a \"noob,\" and when his friend texted him a link to one of his little web app side-projects, Seth ignored the message for days.\n",
      "\n",
      "How come Seth's progress has been sitting at a standstill? How did he end up in this trap, feeling his stomach churn every time he thinks about writing another line of code?\n",
      "\n",
      "Seth says he simply has no idea *what* to program in order to get better. He has no project, nor an idea he wants to get started with. \n",
      "\n",
      "And he doesn't feel comfortable coding the programs he thinks he *should* be able to code by now. There's no going back or going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I call this \"Python Paralysis\"...\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're tired of slogging through another coding tutorial, putting in more effort than most people, but STILL not seeing results... you know why most people don't become professional programmers!\n",
      "\n",
      "The real problem isn't the effort itself, it's all the other stuff that sabotages the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're wondering, I speak from experience here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seth's story is pretty much exactly how I felt in the beginning of any big challenge I ever tackled in my life, whether that's learning how to program, getting my first coder job, or becoming self-employed and starting a business.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're in the same spot right now, here's what you need to realize:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you get through this and keep pressing forward, you're going to get to a stage that's a whole lot better. Push through this, and your efforts will start paying off and people will start respecting you.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes guts and determination to make it past the \"paralysis\" and confusion. You need to have conviction, and a tolerance for pain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me ask you this: How do you KNOW you have a dream? Like, REALLY know it?\n",
      "\n",
      "When it hurts so bad that you can taste it. When you feel your heart lurch in your chest every time you think about the unfulfilled possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's when you need to keep pushing forward, that's when you're oh so close to getting your reward, but you don't see it yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't throw in the towel. Keep pushing forward. \n",
